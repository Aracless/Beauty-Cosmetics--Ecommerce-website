<p>We are required to satisfy one or more of the reasons set out by applicable data privacy law before we can collect and use your personal information.</p>
<p>Generally, our business purpose for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally rely on the following reasons to collect and use your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Performance of a contract</b><br>Using your information may be necessary for us to perform our obligations under a contract with you or with a view to entering into such a contract. For example, where you have: (i) purchased services and/or products from us, we will need to use your information to provide those services and/or products; or (ii) approached us in relation to employment opportunities, the collection and use of your personal information is necessary to enable us to offer you the job role, process your acceptance of the offer, on-board you as an employee and fulfil our obligations as an employer.</li>
<li>
<b>Compliance with our legal obligations</b><br>The collection and use of your personal information may be necessary to enable us to meet our legal obligations. For example, to verify your identity and undertake necessary due diligence checks.</li>
<li>
<b>Pursuing our legitimate interests</b><br>Where such processing is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights, we are permitted to use your personal information where it is necessary in order to pursue our legitimate interests, for example to operate the website and our other digital offerings, to improve our products and services, content and our other digital offerings or to undertake marketing. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make this clear to you at the relevant time.</li>
<li>
<b>Consent</b><br>In some limited circumstances, we may rely on your consent to collect and use your personal information. For example, we may rely on consent: (i) where you have approached us in relation to employment opportunities and have provided us with sensitive personal information, such as information in relation to your racial and ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, physical and mental health, disabilities or trade union membership; or (ii) in relation to the sending of e-marketing or communications.

</ul>
<p>You may not always be required to provide the personal information that we have requested. However, if you choose not to provide certain information, you may not be able to take advantage of some of our services. Any information that is so required is clearly marked as mandatory. If you would prefer that we not collect certain personal information from you, please do not provide us with any such information, or opt out of providing this information where applicable.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
<p>If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), these interests will normally be as set out in this Policy; however, if this changes we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>

<li><b>To any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>5.</b> <b>WHAT ARE MY DATA PROTECTION CHOICES AND RIGHTS?</b></p>
<p>Beauty Cee Cosmetics respects your right to access and control your personal information. You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal information that is not necessary for the purposes of providing you with our Services, you may decline. However, if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a Service, you may not have access to certain features or Services.</p>
<p>We aim to keep all personal information that we hold accurate, complete and up-to-date. While we will use our best efforts to do so, we encourage you to tell us if you change your contact details. However, if you believe that the information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact us at .</p>
<p><b><i>Access to personal information:</i></b> In some jurisdictions, you have the right to request access to your personal information. In these cases, we will comply, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures. Before providing data to you, we will ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge you a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law).</p>
<p><b><i>Correction and deletion:<span> </span></i></b>In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your personal information if it is inaccurate or requires updating. You may also have the right to request deletion of your personal information. Please note that such a request could be refused because your personal information is required to provide you with the products or services you requested, e.g. to deliver a product or send an invoice to your email address, or that it is required by the applicable law.</p>
<p><b><i>Do Not Track: </i></b>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including Kylie Cosmetics, do not respond to DNT signals unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
<p><b>6. WHAT IF I ACCESS A THIRD PARTY SITE THROUGH THE WEBSITE?</b></p>

<p>Please note, while we will honor your request to stop receiving marketing communications, we will continue to send you service-related communications such as emails confirming purchases through the website.</p>
<p><b>9. HOW LONG DOES BEAUTY CEE COSMETICS KEEP MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b></p>
<p>We will retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with access to the beautyceecosmetics.com or other digital offerings, to provide you with a product you have purchased, or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p><b>10. DOES BEAUTY CEE COSMETICS TRANSFER MY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES?</b></p>
<p>In order to provide our services, we may need to transfer and process your personal information internationally (including to destinations outside the country in which you are located).</p>

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p>Further information can be provided on request: please contact us using the details found in the section “How do I contact Kylie Cosmetics?" We have also implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>

<p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures, including physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.</p>
<p>The measures we use to protect your personal information are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, please be aware that no electronic transmission of information can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures that we have in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective.</p>

<p><b>16. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</b></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the state of California, this section addresses your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<b>CCPA</b>”). Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Policy.</p>
<p><b><i>Use of Personal Information</i></b></p>
<p>We may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the business purposes indicated in this Policy.</p>
<p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p>
<p><i>Share and/or Sale of Personal Information</i></p>
<p>For more information on how we share personal information, including the categories of third-parties with which we share personal information, please see the “Does Kylie Cosmetics share my personal information with anyone?” section above.</p>
<p>Under California law, we are required to tell you if we "sell" information. While we do not believe we engage in “selling” information, it is possible that certain of our sharing activities (as described above) may be viewed as a sale. You can opt out of this activity by visiting the<span> </span><button class="ot-sdk-show-settings" id="ot-sdk-btn">Set my cookie choices</button>. You can also opt out by calling us at 000-999-1234 (000-23 Beauty Cee). We do not knowingly sell information of Californians under 16.</p>
<p><i>Your Rights and Choices</i></p>
<p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
<p><b>A. Right to Access Specific Information and Data Portability Right</b></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
<li>If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, the business purpose for which personal information was disclosed, and the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>B. Right to Delete</b></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p><b>C. Exercising Your Rights</b></p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling us a 000-999-1234 (000-23 Beauty Cee)</li>
<li>By submitting your request via the consumer data privacy request form found via this link,<span> </span><a href="https://beautyceecosmetics.com/en-us/privacy-request-form">Consumer Data Privacy Request</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p>You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. If you are submitting on someone else’s behalf we may ask for additional verification. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request.</p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p><i>Non-Discrimination</i><b></b></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.</p>
<p><i>California Shine the Light Law</i><b></b></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such a request, please send an e-mail with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line to <a href="mailto:customerservice@kyliecosmetics.com">customerservice@kyliecosmetics.com</a> or write us at: Coty DTC Holdings, LLC, Attn: Privacy Issues, 350 5th Avenue, 19<sup>th</sup> Floor, New York, NY 10118-0110.</p>
